# Collaboration

## Tips
### Work
Use Github tools such as 'issues' to organize the team around tasks and let them discuss those tasks.<br>
When working on same git, have a separate branch for each team member.<br>
Use GitHub tools such as 'pull requests' to let others comment on or approve the finished work on your branch.

If working on web-development, backend developer can create API definitions for the front-end developer to use.<br>
In general, when programming what will be used by someone else, or when on large projects, it is better to create associated library/API documentations.<br>

If you program a section that will be used by others, it is best to take full responsibility of own code by making sure it is functional by testing it instead of letting others report your bugs.

### Social
Communicate enough, ideally work in same physical space to facilitate communication, at least use Slack or Discord. Communication can assure someone does what he should.

Make sure all participants have a correct attitude, will have enough time to invest in the project, have a similar final vision of the project and similar quality exigency.
