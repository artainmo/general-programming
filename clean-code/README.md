# How to write clean code

Read 'Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship - Martin Robert' for more information.

Write with consistent code style throughout the team.

For clean code use descriptive variables and function names, if the name consists of multiple words those words can be separated by '\_' (snake_case) or each first letter of new word can be capitalized (camelCase).<br>
Global variables are best avoided and if used its name should start with 'g_'.

Also talk about concept of 'separation of concern'.

Variables are best declared at top of function, initializing them can be followed.<br>
Tabs can be used for proper identation.<br>
Long lines can be transformed into multiple shorter lines.
