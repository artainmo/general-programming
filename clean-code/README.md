CleanCode -> Write with consistent code style also throughout the team

For clean code use descriptive variables names, if the name consists of multiple words those words can be separated by _ or each first letter of new word can be capitalized.

Also talk about basic writing rules such as variables declaration at top of function, initialization under it, usage of proper indentation, long lines can be set onto multiple ones, each task has own small function with descriptive name...
Comments can be used but not too much...
Re-read the clean code book and create a summary.
global variables are best avoided and if used its name starts with g_

Also talk about naming variables:
Variables best have a descriptive name to make the code readable.
Writing multiple words as a variable name is best done using the snake_case or camelCase.
