Programming consists of giving instructions via written code to an operating system. Those instructions usually manage data, define screen display or audio.

An operating system (OS) is the software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling users to run applications, manage files, and control hardware.<br>
Personal computers usually have as operating systems macOS (from Apple), Windows (from Windowns), and Linux (open-source). Different operating systems demand you to interact differently with them, even code differently to some extent, usually the one we are familiar with we prefer. Mobile operating systems are Android (from Samsung) and iOS (from Apple). Other operating systems also exist, such as for embedded systems, servers, networks.<br>
Operating systems are essential for running computers and devices, managing resources, and providing user interfaces.

When programming we usually start by interacting with a terminal and shell. A terminal is an interface that allows you to interact with the computer by entering commands. A shell is a program that interprets and executes the commands you type by acting as a command-line interface (CLI) between the user and the operating system. They work together, you open a terminal to interact with the shell. They allow you to navigate between folders, create folders, create the files in which you will code, and [a lot more](https://github.com/artainmo/general-programming/tree/main/shell).

In the end we need to code in files. For this we use specialized [text editors](https://github.com/artainmo/general-programming/tree/main/text-editors).
