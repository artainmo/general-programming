# C
C is a language where the programmer needs to manage memory himself.<br>
This makes the language more difficult to write but useful when programming in electronics on systems with limited memory where we want to be able to control memory frugally.
In this Rust course I talk about [memory management](https://github.com/artainmo/general-programming/tree/main/languages/rust#Understanding-Ownership).

Read the code and comments to learn about the language via those projects ([piscine C](https://github.com/artainmo/c), [libft](https://github.com/artainmo/libft)).<br>
In the project [get-next-line](https://github.com/artainmo/get_next_line) we learn to read files and in the project [philosophers](https://github.com/artainmo/philosophers) we learn to use mutexes, semaphores, threads and processes via forks.
