# Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented and functional programming. It has a comprehensive standard library.<br>
Python is often used in data science or machine learning projects.
