### Introduction
Rust is useful in allowing one to 'dip down' into lower-level control without risking crashes or security holes. But it is not limited to low-level systems programming, it can also be used to make command-line-interface apps and web servers.<br>
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design, Rust challenges that conflict. Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.<br>
Rust provides speed and stability. Speed both in terms of writing and executing.<br>
Rust basically is a general-purpose, high-level programming language with detailed control as found in a low-level programming language. Thus Rust tries to be it all.
