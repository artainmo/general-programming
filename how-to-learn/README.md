general advise for learning programming (research & stackoverflow, gloabl intuition by learnign multiple languages, practicing by creating complete projects to start learning, sneak on multiple githubs when starting a new language to be exposed to different coding styles/used-concepts....)
codecademy is a platform I like to learn.

It is important to be aware of all the different concepts/possibilities, to first know what is programatically possible, in a second time specifically-how-to can be researched while coding.

Not all features in all languages are practical or clean, they can increase the chance of errors occuring, be confusing or unreadable, so complete language doesn't has to be learned/used.

Advice should also be given about researching the necessary information or learning on the job, as this is impotant in programming because it is impossible to know all. stackoverflow, geeksforgeeks, grepper, tutorialspoint,...

Also talk about the grepper plugin and overall importance of google search.

Also have notes surrounding researching while coding. Talk about chatGPT, stackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, medium, official documentation... On medium if an article is not accessible try opening it in private browser instead.
