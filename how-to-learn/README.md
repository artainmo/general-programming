# Learn programming

## Tips

#### 1. Learn the fundamental concepts to know what is possible
It is important to be aware of all the different concepts/possibilities, to first know what is programatically possible, in a second time specifically-how-to can be researched while coding.
codecademy is a platform I like to learn. 
While learning a language I like to take notes. Those notes can be used when wanting to learn the language again as a quick reminder.

Not all features in all languages are practical or clean, they can increase the chance of errors occuring, be confusing or unreadable, so complete language doesn't has to be learned/used.

#### 2. Practice and know the precise syntax
practicing by creating complete projects to start learning
sneak on multiple githubs when starting a new language to be exposed to different coding styles/used-concepts

###### 2.1 Find answers on the fly
Advice should also be given about researching the necessary information or learning on the job, as this is impotant in programming because it is impossible to know all. stackoverflow, geeksforgeeks, grepper, tutorialspoint,... Talk about chatGPT, stackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, medium, official documentation... On medium if an article is not accessible try opening it in private browser instead.
Also talk about the grepper plugin and overall importance of google search.
You can ask very specific programming questions to chatGPT. Don't be afraid to even add your specific code and error messages within your requests. If you are unsure about what chatGPT is recommending, research on google if what he is saying is correct.
If you cannot find an answer using chatGPT nor Google, last resort is to ask your question on StackOverflow. Answer can come rather quickly after one hour. Make sure to be consice in your question while still giving all the necessary informations, such as showing your codes, what you tried, your conclusions based on that...

#### 3. Experience and general intuition
