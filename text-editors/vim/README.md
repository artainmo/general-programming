# VIM

Vim is an editor used by programmers to edit a text file.<br>
Its first advantage is that while using it only the keyboard is necessary, thus you don't even need to lift hand to the mouse which is faster.<br>
Its second advantage is that it is very customizable.<br>
Its disadvantage is that a learning curve exists for its use.

## Use

There are two modes in vim. One is the command mode and another is the insert mode.<br>
In the command mode, the user can move around the file, delete text, etc.<br>
In the insert mode, the user can insert text.<br>
To go from command mode to insert mode use [a text entry command](#).<br>
To go from insert mode to command mode type 'Esc'.

*Other Useful Commands

Most commands can be repeated n times by typing a number, n, before the command. For example 10dd means delete 10 lines. gg and G can be used to indicate start and end of file for example gg=G to indent whole file.

R -> Begin overstrike or replace mode ï¿½ use ESC key to exit

'esc' followed by '/' -> search for pattern

:/ pattern -> Search forward for the pattern

:? pattern -> Search backward for the pattern

:g/pat1/s//pat2/g -> replace every occurrence of pattern1 (pat1) with pat2. Example :g/tIO/s//Ada.Text_IO/g. This will find and replace tIO by Ada.text_IO everywhere in the file.  :g/a/s// /g replace the letter a, by blank :g/a/s///g replace a by nothing

option + mouse -> copy/paste outside shell

gg=G -> =, the indent command can take motions. So, gg to get the start of the file, = to indent, G to the end of the file, gg=G. So line numbers can be used instead of gg/G.
